# Stock Trend Prediction WebApp

## Description
This Stock Trend Prediction WebApp was created in Python using streamlit to create a GUI for users to input stocks they wish to predict, 
it displays the raw data in a table, and provides visualizations of the predicted versus original values. The predictions are made using a multi-layer LSTM recurrent neural network 
to predict the last value out of a sequence of values.
